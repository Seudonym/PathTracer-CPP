# PathTracer-CPP
This repos contains a PathTracer made completely from scratch in C++, using as little external libraries as possible. It writes the output image as a [PPM (Portable Pixel Map)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) file. High-Res skyboxes can be added now. Future plans include transparent materials, a proper camera class, denoising and defocus blur.

An example render(1280x720):

# PathTracer-CPP
This repos contains a PathTracer made completely from scratch in C++, using as little external libraries as possible. It writes the output image as a [PPM (Portable Pixel Map)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) file. The [stb_image library](https://github.com/nothings/stb) is used for reading in the skybox.

An example render(1024x720):
